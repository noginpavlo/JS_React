This is basically Chat GPT generated stady plan to learn minimal JS syntax to be React literate.

Chatt url: https://chatgpt.com/c/6840167a-1114-800a-befc-9346ff04d620

✅ Phase 1: JavaScript Fundamentals for React
Topics:
Variables (let, const)

Data Types (strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects)

Functions

Function declarations

Arrow functions

Conditionals (if, else, ternary operator)

Loops (especially for, for...of, forEach)

Basic Array Methods (map, filter, find)

Template Literals (`Hello, ${name}`)

Basic DOM Console Testing (using console.log() effectively)

✅ Capstone Mini Project 1:
"Simple User List Filter"

An array of users (objects).

A function that filters users by age or name substring.

Display result in a console.log() formatted string.

✅ Phase 2: Objects and Arrays in Practice
Topics:
Object Syntax

Accessing properties

Destructuring objects and arrays

Spread and Rest Operators (...)

Array/Object Immutability (important for React state)

Truthy and Falsy values

Optional Chaining (?.) and Nullish Coalescing (??)

✅ Capstone Mini Project 2:
"User Card Generator"

You receive a list of user data (name, age, address).

You format each into a string (like a card).

Bonus: Skip users with missing info using optional chaining.

✅ Phase 3: JavaScript Essentials for React Components
Topics:
Import/Export

ES6 Modules

Arrow Functions as Components

JSX Prerequisites

Difference between HTML and JSX

Embedding expressions ({} inside JSX)

Ternary operator in JSX (Conditional rendering basics)

Short-circuit rendering (&&)

Basic Event Handling (onClick functions)

✅ Capstone Mini Project 3:
"Simple JSX Card App"

Create functions that return strings simulating JSX cards.

Use ternary and && to conditionally show different content.

Import data from another file.

✅ Phase 4: State and Interaction Patterns (Prep for React State)
Topics:
Primitive vs Reference Types

Function Scope & Closures (light intro)

Callback Functions

Basic Timing Functions (setTimeout / setInterval)

Functional Updates (important for state changes)

✅ Capstone Mini Project 4:
"Counter App Logic (no React yet)"

A basic counter:

Increment

Decrement

Reset

Include a delay using setTimeout.

All interactions handled by JS functions and object state (mocking React behavior).
